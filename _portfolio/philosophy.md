My philosophical framework is rooted in dialectical liberatory praxis—the symbiotic interplay of critical reflection and transformative action—as a means to dismantle oppressive systems and cultivate collective freedom. Grounded in the works of Paulo Freire, Myles Horton, bell hooks, Frantz Fanon, and other critical theorists, this framework rejects neutrality in education, insisting instead that teaching and learning must be acts of resistance, healing, and reclamation. Below, I outline the core pillars of my approach, weaving together feminist, decolonial, Marxist, and critical race theories to advance a pedagogy of radical hope and embodied justice.

 

## Praxis as Revolutionary Dialogue

“*Education either functions as an instrument to bring about conformity or becomes the practice of freedom*.” —Paulo Freire

Liberatory praxis begins with dialogue that bridges theory and lived experience. Drawing on Freire’s conscientização (critical consciousness), I frame education as a collaborative process where adult learners interrogate the sociopolitical conditions shaping their epistemologies. This dialogue is inherently feminist (hooks, Lorde) and decolonial (Mignolo, Quijano), centering marginalized voices as sites of knowledge production. By engaging learners in problem-posing rather than banking education, we co-create narratives that expose power structures—capitalism, settler colonialism, white supremacy—and imagine alternatives.
 

## Intersectionality as Epistemic Resistance

“*There is no such thing as a single-issue struggle because we do not live single-issue lives*.” —Audre Lorde

My work prioritizes intersectionality (Crenshaw, Lorde) to confront the multiplicative violence of systemic oppression. Following Angela Davis and Toni Morrison, I analyze how race, gender, class, and coloniality coalesce to regulate access to knowledge and dignity. For adult learners in post-truth societies, this means:

**Critiquing epistemicide**: Challenging the erasure of Indigenous, Black, and queer knowledges (Mignolo, Lugones).

**Embodied inquiry**: Recognizing how marginalized bodies carry histories of resistance (Fanon, Morrison).

**Solidarity across difference**: Building coalitions that honor pluralistic truths without relativizing oppression (Lugones’s world-travelling).
 

## Decolonizing Knowledge and Being

“*Decolonization is not a metaphor*.” —Tuck & Yang

Informed by Indigenous and decolonial theories (Quijano, Mignolo, Tuck & Yang), my framework rejects the Eurocentric, neoliberal logics that fragment knowledge and commodify learning. Instead, I advocate for:

**Relational epistemologies**: Learning practices rooted in reciprocity, land-based wisdom, and communal accountability.

**Unsettling coloniality**: Exposing how modernity/coloniality constructs hierarchies of humanity (Quijano’s coloniality of power) and perpetuates epistemic bubbles.

**Reclamation as praxis**: Supporting learners in recovering subjugated histories and languages, fostering what María Lugones calls “decolonial love.”
 

## Radical Imagination as Collective Liberation

“*Without new visions, we don’t know what to build, only what to knock down*.” —Robin D.G. Kelley

Liberatory education demands radical imagination—a Marxist-feminist commitment to envisioning worlds beyond capitalist exploitation and carceral logics (Davis, Marx). This involves:

**Critical hope**: bell hooks’s insistence on education as “the practice of freedom” amid despair.

**Prefigurative politics**: Creating microcosms of justice within classrooms (e.g., democratic decision-making, resource sharing).

**Joy as resistance**: Following Toni Morrison, centering joy and creativity as acts of defiance against dehumanization.

 

## Methodological Commitments
 
My praxis is embodied through:

- Participatory action research: Collaborating with communities to design curricula that address localized oppressions.

- Testimonio: Amplifying first-person narratives as pedagogical tools (a la Latina feminist epistemology).

- Abolitionist pedagogy: Dismantling punitive educational structures and fostering restorative, learner-centered spaces.

 

## Vision
​
I strive to create educational ecosystems where adult learners are not merely “critical” but creators of liberatory futures. By intertwining Marxist critiques of capital, feminist ethics of care, and decolonial demands for land/body sovereignty, my work seeks to rupture epistemic bubbles and equip learners to re-member—to piece together fragmented selves and societies.
