# My Research and Manuscript Workflow

I use a combination of Zotero, GitHub, VSCode, and LaTeX to organize and prepare research and manuscripts. This integrated approach allows me to maintain version control, track project progress systematically, and produce publication-ready documents with professional typesetting. Below I explain how I integrate these various programs, websites, code, and formatting languages to achieve this comprehensive workflow.

## Core Tools Integration

<details>
<summary>LaTeX for Professional Typesetting</summary>

LaTeX serves as the foundation of my document preparation system. Unlike traditional word processors, LaTeX separates content from formatting, allowing me to focus on writing while ensuring consistent, publication-quality output. I primarily use the `apa7` document class for APA-compliant manuscripts, which automatically handles:

- Proper margins and spacing
- Citation formatting
- Reference list generation  
- Section heading styles
- Title page formatting

The beauty of LaTeX lies in its ability to handle complex academic documents with mathematical expressions, cross-references, and extensive bibliographies without the formatting inconsistencies common in traditional word processors.

<details>
<summary>VSCode as the Central Hub</summary>

Visual Studio Code serves as my primary writing environment, enhanced with the LaTeX Workshop extension. This setup provides:

- **Syntax highlighting** for LaTeX commands
- **Live PDF preview** with automatic compilation
- **Error detection** and debugging assistance
- **Integrated terminal** for Git commands
- **Extensions ecosystem** including grammar checking with LTeX+

The integrated terminal is particularly valuable as it allows me to manage Git operations without leaving my writing environment, maintaining focus and workflow efficiency.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Zotero with Better BibTeX for Reference Management</summary>

Zotero manages all my research sources, enhanced by the Better BibTeX plugin for seamless LaTeX integration. My reference workflow includes:

1. **Collection Organization**: Sources are organized into project-specific collections
2. **Automatic Export**: Better BibTeX maintains synchronized `.bib` files that update automatically as I add new sources
3. **Citation Keys**: Consistent citation key formatting ensures reliable cross-referencing
4. **PDF Management**: Full-text PDFs are stored and searchable within Zotero

This integration means I can add sources to Zotero throughout my research process, and they immediately become available for citation in my LaTeX documents without manual export steps.
</details>

## GitHub Project Management Workflow

<details>
<summary>Academic Coursework Tracking</summary>

Beyond manuscript preparation, I use GitHub Projects to manage my entire doctoral program coursework and deadlines. Each semester and course is organized systematically:

**Program-Level Organization:**
- **Semesters as Milestones**: Fall 2024, Spring 2025, Summer 2025, etc.
- **Courses as Major Issues**: Each course (EDACE 780, EDACE 830, etc.) becomes a tracked issue
- **Assignments as Sub-Issues**: Individual assignments, papers, and deliverables within each course

**Course Progress Tracking:**
- **Labels by Course Type**: "Core Course", "Research Methods", "Electives"
- **Priority Levels**: High (current semester), Medium (next semester), Low (future planning)
- **Progress Indicators**: "Not Started", "In Progress", "Submitted", "Graded"
- **Due Date Management**: All assignment deadlines tracked in GitHub Issues with calendar integration

**Practical Example - Current Coursework:**
```
Summer 2025 Milestone:
├── Issue: EDACE 790 - Characteristics of Adult Learners
│   ├── Sub-issue: Literature Review Paper (Due: June 15)
│   ├── Sub-issue: Reflection Essay (Due: June 25)
│   └── Sub-issue: Final Project (Due: June 27)
└── Issue: EDACE 785 - Curriculum Design
    ├── Sub-issue: Curriculum Outline (Due: July 15)
    ├── Sub-issue: Unit Development (Due: July 30)
    └── Sub-issue: Final Curriculum (Due: August 8)
```

This approach transforms my Gantt chart planning into an actionable, digital project management system where every course component is tracked, deadlines are visible, and progress is measurable.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Repository Structure and Branching Strategy</summary>

Each research project or manuscript is organized as a GitHub directory with my PhD-Projects repository with a clear structure:

```
project-name/
├── docs/
│   ├── main.tex
│   ├── sections/
│   │   ├── introduction.tex
│   │   ├── methodology.tex
│   │   └── conclusion.tex
│   └── figures/
├── references.bib
├── README.md
└── .gitignore
```

I use a **feature-branch workflow** where each major component or revision is developed on its own branch:
- `main` branch contains the stable, submission-ready version
- `feature/literature-review` for developing the literature review section
- `feature/data-analysis` for analysis and results sections
- `revision/reviewer-comments` for addressing peer review feedback
</details>

<details>
<summary>Issues for Task and Progress Tracking</summary>

GitHub Issues serve as my comprehensive project management system, handling both research manuscripts and coursework:

**Research Project Issues:**
- **Milestone Issues**: "Complete first draft by [date]"
- **Section Issues**: "Draft methodology section"
- **Revision Issues**: "Address Reviewer 2 comments on data interpretation"
- **Technical Issues**: "Fix citation formatting for Figure 3"

**Coursework Issues:**
- **Course-Level Issues**: "EDACE 785 - Curriculum Design (Summer 2025)"
- **Assignment Issues**: "Design learning objectives for Unit 2"
- **Reading Issues**: "Complete assigned readings for Week 3"
- **Project Issues**: "Final curriculum design project submission"

Each issue includes:
- Clear acceptance criteria and deliverables
- Due dates aligned with syllabus and project timelines
- Labels for type (coursework, research, writing, revision)
- Priority levels based on deadlines and importance
- Progress updates and reflection notes
- Links to relevant course materials and resources
</details>

<details>
<summary>Project Boards for Visual Management</summary>

I organize issues using GitHub Project boards with columns representing workflow stages for both research and coursework:

**Research Workflow Columns:**
- **Backlog**: All planned tasks and sections
- **In Progress**: Currently active work (limited to 2-3 items)
- **Review**: Completed sections awaiting self-review or feedback
- **Revision Needed**: Items requiring changes based on feedback
- **Done**: Completed and approved sections

**Coursework Workflow Columns:**
- **This Week**: Current assignments and readings
- **Next Week**: Upcoming deadlines and preparations
- **In Progress**: Ongoing projects and papers
- **Submitted**: Awaiting grading or feedback
- **Completed**: Finished coursework with grades received

**Integrated Academic Dashboard:**
I maintain a master project board that combines both research and coursework, using color-coded labels to distinguish between different types of work. This provides a comprehensive view of all academic obligations and helps balance research productivity with coursework demands.

This Kanban-style approach provides clear visibility into project status across all academic activities and prevents work overload by limiting work-in-progress items.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Pull Request Process for Quality Control</summary>

When completing a section or major revision, I create pull requests to merge feature branches into main:

1. **Self-Review**: Review all changes, check for LaTeX errors, verify citations
2. **Descriptive PR**: Include summary of changes, link to resolved issues
3. **Documentation**: Update README with any workflow changes
4. **Merge**: After approval, merge and delete feature branch

This process creates a clear audit trail of document evolution and ensures nothing enters the main branch without review.
