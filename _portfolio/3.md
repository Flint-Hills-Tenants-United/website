### My Research and Manuscript Workflow

I use a combination of Zotero, GitHub, VSCode, and LaTeX to organize and prepare research and manuscripts. This integrated approach allows me to maintain version control, track project progress systematically, and produce publication-ready documents with professional typesetting. Below I explain how I integrate these various programs, websites, code, and formatting languages to achieve this comprehensive workflow.

### Core Tools Integration

<details>
<summary>LaTeX for Professional Typesetting</summary>

<p>LaTeX serves as the foundation of my document preparation system. Unlike traditional word processors, LaTeX separates content from formatting, allowing me to focus on writing while ensuring consistent, publication-quality output. I primarily use the <code>apa7</code> document class for APA-compliant manuscripts, which automatically handles:</p>

<ul>
<li>Proper margins and spacing</li>
<li>Citation formatting</li>
<li>Reference list generation</li>
<li>Section heading styles</li>
<li>Title page formatting</li>
</ul>

<p>The beauty of LaTeX lies in its ability to handle complex academic documents with mathematical expressions, cross-references, and extensive bibliographies without the formatting inconsistencies common in traditional word processors.</p>

</details>

<details>
<summary>VSCode as the Central Hub</summary>

<p>Visual Studio Code serves as my primary writing environment, enhanced with the LaTeX Workshop extension. This setup provides:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Syntax highlighting</strong> for LaTeX commands</li>
<li><strong>Live PDF preview</strong> with automatic compilation</li>
<li><strong>Error detection</strong> and debugging assistance</li>
<li><strong>Integrated terminal</strong> for Git commands</li>
<li><strong>Extensions ecosystem</strong> including grammar checking with LTeX+</li>
</ul>

<p>The integrated terminal is particularly valuable as it allows me to manage Git operations without leaving my writing environment, maintaining focus and workflow efficiency.</p>

</details>

<details>
<summary>Zotero with Better BibTeX for Reference Management</summary>

<p>Zotero manages all my research sources, enhanced by the Better BibTeX plugin for seamless LaTeX integration. My reference workflow includes:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Collection Organization</strong>: Sources are organized into project-specific collections</li>
<li><strong>Automatic Export</strong>: Better BibTeX maintains synchronized <code>.bib</code> files that update automatically as I add new sources</li>
<li><strong>Citation Keys</strong>: Consistent citation key formatting ensures reliable cross-referencing</li>
<li><strong>PDF Management</strong>: Full-text PDFs are stored and searchable within Zotero</li>
</ol>

<p>This integration means I can add sources to Zotero throughout my research process, and they immediately become available for citation in my LaTeX documents without manual export steps.</p>

</details>

### GitHub Project Management Workflow

<details>
<summary>Academic Coursework Tracking</summary>

<p>Beyond manuscript preparation, I use GitHub Projects to manage my entire doctoral program coursework and deadlines. Each semester and course is organized systematically:</p>

<p><strong>Program-Level Organization:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Semesters as Milestones</strong>: Fall 2024, Spring 2025, Summer 2025, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Courses as Major Issues</strong>: Each course (EDACE 780, EDACE 830, etc.) becomes a tracked issue</li>
<li><strong>Assignments as Sub-Issues</strong>: Individual assignments, papers, and deliverables within each course</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Course Progress Tracking:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Labels by Course Type</strong>: "Core Course", "Research Methods", "Electives"</li>
<li><strong>Priority Levels</strong>: High (current semester), Medium (next semester), Low (future planning)</li>
<li><strong>Progress Indicators</strong>: "Not Started", "In Progress", "Submitted", "Graded"</li>
<li><strong>Due Date Management</strong>: All assignment deadlines tracked in GitHub Issues with calendar integration</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Practical Example - Current Coursework:</strong></p>
<pre><code>Summer 2025 Milestone:
├── Issue: EDACE 790 - Characteristics of Adult Learners
│   ├── Sub-issue: Literature Review Paper (Due: June 15)
│   ├── Sub-issue: Reflection Essay (Due: June 25)
│   └── Sub-issue: Final Project (Due: June 27)
└── Issue: EDACE 785 - Curriculum Design
    ├── Sub-issue: Curriculum Outline (Due: July 15)
    ├── Sub-issue: Unit Development (Due: July 30)
    └── Sub-issue: Final Curriculum (Due: August 8)</code></pre>

<p>This approach transforms my Gantt chart planning into an actionable, digital project management system where every course component is tracked, deadlines are visible, and progress is measurable.</p>

</details>

<details>
<summary>Repository Structure and Branching Strategy</summary>

<p>Each research project or manuscript is organized as a GitHub repository with a clear structure:</p>

<pre><code>project-name/
├── docs/
│   ├── main.tex
│   ├── sections/
│   │   ├── introduction.tex
│   │   ├── methodology.tex
│   │   └── conclusion.tex
│   └── figures/
├── references.bib
├── README.md
└── .gitignore</code></pre>

<p>I use a <strong>feature-branch workflow</strong> where each major component or revision is developed on its own branch:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>main</code> branch contains the stable, submission-ready version</li>
<li><code>feature/literature-review</code> for developing the literature review section</li>
<li><code>feature/data-analysis</code> for analysis and results sections</li>
<li><code>revision/reviewer-comments</code> for addressing peer review feedback</li>
</ul>

</details>

<details>
<summary>Issues for Task and Progress Tracking</summary>

<p>GitHub Issues serve as my comprehensive project management system, handling both research manuscripts and coursework:</p>

<p><strong>Research Project Issues:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Milestone Issues</strong>: "Complete first draft by [date]"</li>
<li><strong>Section Issues</strong>: "Draft methodology section"</li>
<li><strong>Revision Issues</strong>: "Address Reviewer 2 comments on data interpretation"</li>
<li><strong>Technical Issues</strong>: "Fix citation formatting for Figure 3"</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Coursework Issues:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Course-Level Issues</strong>: "EDACE 785 - Curriculum Design (Summer 2025)"</li>
<li><strong>Assignment Issues</strong>: "Design learning objectives for Unit 2"</li>
<li><strong>Reading Issues</strong>: "Complete assigned readings for Week 3"</li>
<li><strong>Project Issues</strong>: "Final curriculum design project submission"</li>
</ul>

<p>Each issue includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clear acceptance criteria and deliverables</li>
<li>Due dates aligned with syllabus and project timelines</li>
<li>Labels for type (coursework, research, writing, revision)</li>
<li>Priority levels based on deadlines and importance</li>
<li>Progress updates and reflection notes</li>
<li>Links to relevant course materials and resources</li>
</ul>

</details>

<details>
<summary>Project Boards for Visual Management</summary>

<p>I organize issues using GitHub Project boards with columns representing workflow stages for both research and coursework:</p>

<p><strong>Research Workflow Columns:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Backlog</strong>: All planned tasks and sections</li>
<li><strong>In Progress</strong>: Currently active work (limited to 2-3 items)</li>
<li><strong>Review</strong>: Completed sections awaiting self-review or feedback</li>
<li><strong>Revision Needed</strong>: Items requiring changes based on feedback</li>
<li><strong>Done</strong>: Completed and approved sections</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Coursework Workflow Columns:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>This Week</strong>: Current assignments and readings</li>
<li><strong>Next Week</strong>: Upcoming deadlines and preparations</li>
<li><strong>In Progress</strong>: Ongoing projects and papers</li>
<li><strong>Submitted</strong>: Awaiting grading or feedback</li>
<li><strong>Completed</strong>: Finished coursework with grades received</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Integrated Academic Dashboard:</strong><br>
I maintain a master project board that combines both research and coursework, using color-coded labels to distinguish between different types of work. This provides a comprehensive view of all academic obligations and helps balance research productivity with coursework demands.</p>

<p>This Kanban-style approach provides clear visibility into project status across all academic activities and prevents work overload by limiting work-in-progress items.</p>

</details>

<details>
<summary>Pull Request Process for Quality Control</summary>

<p>When completing a section or major revision, I create pull requests to merge feature branches into main:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Self-Review</strong>: Review all changes, check for LaTeX errors, verify citations</li>
<li><strong>Descriptive PR</strong>: Include summary of changes, link to resolved issues</li>
<li><strong>Documentation</strong>: Update README with any workflow changes</li>
<li><strong>Merge</strong>: After approval, merge and delete feature branch</li>
</ol>

<p>This process creates a clear audit trail of document evolution and ensures nothing enters the main branch without review.</p>

</details>
