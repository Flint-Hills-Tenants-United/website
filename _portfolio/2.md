### Organizing For Accountability

Have you had a picky landlord who doesn’t ever get on maintenance requests? Or maybe they swiped your security deposit, and you can’t get it back? Landlords often take advantage of tenants because they don’t know the law. So what should you do if you find yourself in a position where you think that your landlord has violated your lease agreement or is not following federal, state, and local law when it comes to their obligations as the owner of your property?

1. **Know your rights**
You will want to start by reading and understanding your lease agreement that you signed. You have a legal right to a safe and livable home. Kansas law requires landlords to make timely repairs and maintain essential services. If your unit has problems like broken plumbing, no heat, or unsafe wiring—and your landlord refuses to act— they may be violating your rights. Keep written records of all requests and take photos to document the issue.

2. **You're not alone–talk to  your neighbors**
If your landlord isn’t responding to maintenance requests, chances are your neighbors are facing the same issues. Talk to each other. Create a group chat. Share experiences. Compare what you've been told and what has (or hasn’t) happened. This builds the groundwork for a tenant association—a powerful first step toward collective action. Problems that landlords ignore individually are often addressed when tenants organize together.

3. **Organize as a tenant association**
A tenant association is a group of renters in the same building or property who unite to demand safe and fair housing. As a group, you can draft a shared list of concerns, meet with the landlord together, or bring public attention to the issue. Flint Hills Tenants United can help you get started.

4. **Make all requests in writing**
When you make any requests to your landlord or property management company or have any conversations with them, follow up with them in writing. Be clear, specific, and
document everything. Send a letter or email that includes the date, the problem, and a deadline for response. Kansas law doesn’t require written requests—but they create a paper trail, which is crucial if things escalate.

5. **Collective action gets results**
Landlords often delay or deny repairs until tenants push back—together. You have the right to form a tenant association, hold meetings, and advocate for yourselves. You are protected from retaliation for organizing. Flint Hills Tenants United can support you with resources, organizing help, and know-your-rights education.

### Important Forms

The following forms can be used for various actions you may need to take, due to a breach of contract with your landlord. They range from demanding your landlord fix basic safety issues, to getting your security deposit back, to breaking your lease for other necessary reasons. **Please keep a copy of every single form, message, agreement, etc., for your records should you have to go to court.** Shout out to Paul Shipp and Kansas Legal Services for working with us on these issues!
