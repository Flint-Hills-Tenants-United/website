My research explores the intersection of social epistemology and adult learning, with a focus on how individuals in post-truth societies navigate—and transcend—epistemic bubbles and echo chambers. Central to my work is an investigation of the psychosocial dimensions of knowledge acquisition, retention, transmission, and assessment, particularly as they relate to moral reasoning, social identity formation, and reflective judgment.

 

In an era marked by fragmented information ecosystems and polarized discourse, adult learners occupy a critical space: they are both products of entrenched sociocognitive frameworks and agents capable of transformative epistemic growth. My research examines how adults interrogate and revise entrenched beliefs, particularly when confronted with disinformation, ideological polarization, or conflicting evidence. I interrogate the mechanisms by which individuals:

 

- Reconcile moral intuitions with epistemic responsibility, balancing personal values against the demands of critical inquiry.

- Negotiate social identity in knowledge communities, navigating tensions between belonging and intellectual autonomy.

- Cultivate reflective judgment, developing the metacognitive skills to assess the reliability of sources, the validity of claims, and the ethical implications of knowledge practices.

 

Drawing on interdisciplinary frameworks from philosophy, cognitive psychology, education, and sociology, I analyze how adult learners rebuild epistemic agency in contexts where trust in institutions and experts is eroded. My work emphasizes the role of liberatory praxis in fostering intellectual humility, collaborative inquiry, and adaptive resilience. I also investigate structural barriers—such as algorithmic curation of information and neoliberal inequities in access to education—that perpetuate epistemic isolation.


This research aims to contribute actionable insights for educators, policymakers, and community leaders seeking to design interventions that empower adults to critically engage with complex information landscapes. By illuminating pathways out of epistemic entrenchment, I seek to advance a vision of lifelong learning that prioritizes not only individual intellectual growth but also collective epistemic well-being in a pluralistic democracy. Ultimately, I strive to bridge empirical research and normative theory, fostering societies where knowledge is not merely acquired but ethically lived.
