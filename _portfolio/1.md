### Know your rights!

It is important that you know your rights and that starts with reading your lease thoroughly. A landlord is legally obligated to provide a safe and habitable living environment for their tenants. Some leases cover the basics that are required by federal, state, and local laws, others provide more rights to the tenant. It is important that you understand your lease and what it means for what you and your landlord can and cannot do, according to state and local laws.

After you have read your lease, read the <a href="https://www.kansaslegalservices.org/files/THB.pdf" target="_blank">Kansas Tenants Handbook</a>. It is important to understand that you are the expert on your experience as a tenant. Another great resource is <a href="https://www.kansaslegalservices.org/node/1934/tenant-issues-and-rights-kansas-renters" target="_blank">this Kansas Legal Services</a> essential information guide. It is a must read!
