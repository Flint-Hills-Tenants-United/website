<p>Hello and welcome! We are Flint Hills Tenants United and we are helping your neighbors organize toward holding Geary Estates Apartments accountable. We are not a legal service or professional organization, but are fellow renters who live in and around the Flint Hills who believe that everyone deserves safe, secure, and affordable housing! We hope you will join your neighbors in organizing a Geary Estates Tenant Association to collectively demand better of MRD Apartments. To do so, please read the Frequently Asked Questions below, and if you would like to learn more and/or join, fill out the form.</p>

<h1>Geary Estates Tenant Association — Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<br>

<details>
  <summary><strong>What is a tenant association?</strong></summary>
  <p>
    A tenant association is simply a group of renters in the same property who band together to address common concerns and advocate for better living conditions 
    (<a href="https://tenantresourcecenter.org/what_is_a_tenant_association" target="_blank">source</a>). 
    In other words, it’s neighbors uniting so we have <strong>strength in numbers</strong> to achieve things we couldn’t achieve alone. 
    By forming an association, tenants can share information, support each other, and present a <strong>unified voice</strong> when dealing with the landlord or management. 
    The goal is to <strong>work together for fair, safe, and livable homes</strong> for everyone in the complex.
  </p>
</details>

<br><br>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Why do we need a tenant association at Geary Estates?</strong></summary>
  <p>
    Residents at Geary Estates have faced recurring problems that haven’t been resolved through individual complaints. 
    Many have reported <strong>ignored maintenance requests and poor upkeep</strong> — Google reviews mention that management “ignore &amp; delete maintenance requests” and that apartments “get worse due to lack of upkeep.” 
  </p>
  <p>
    When tenants go one-by-one, it’s easy for management to delay or dismiss concerns. But if we <strong>join together</strong>, we can <strong>hold the landlord accountable</strong> and demand that these issues be fixed. 
    Flint Hills Tenants United has seen that <strong>issues ignored individually are often resolved collectively</strong>. 
    Forming an association gives us the collective power to demand <strong>safe, well-maintained homes and fair treatment</strong> for everyone here.
  </p>
</details>

<br><br>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Is it legal to form a tenant association?</strong></summary>
  <p>
    Yes. <strong>It is your right to organize</strong> with your fellow tenants. Kansas law explicitly protects tenants who form or join an association. 
    Under the <a href="https://kslegislature.org/li_2014/b2013_14/statute/058_000_0000_chapter/058_025_0000_article/058_025_0072_section/058_025_0072_k/" target="_blank">Kansas Residential Landlord and Tenant Act</a>, landlords 
    <strong>cannot retaliate</strong> against you for joining or organizing with other tenants. 
    That means they can’t raise your rent, cut off services, or try to evict you simply because you joined an association. 
    Organizing is fully legal and protected — no lease clause can forbid you from meeting or advocating for your rights.
  </p>
</details>

<br><br>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Will the landlord retaliate if I join?</strong></summary>
  <p>
    It’s natural to worry about retaliation, but <strong>the law protects you</strong>. 
    Kansas law forbids landlords from retaliating when tenants organize or complain in good faith 
    (<a href="https://ksrevisor.org/statutes/chapters/ch58/058_025_0072.html" target="_blank">K.S.A. 58-2572</a>). 
  </p>
  <p>
    They can’t legally evict you, raise rent, or reduce services for being part of an association. 
    If they tried, you’d have a legal defense, and any such action could be challenged in court. 
    That said, some landlords might still try indirect tactics — that’s why we build <strong>strength in numbers</strong>. 
    When half or more of tenants unite, it’s almost impossible to target individuals. 
    <strong>Retaliation is illegal</strong>, and together we can make sure it stays that way.
  </p>
</details>

<br><br>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Why aim for over 50% of tenants to join?</strong></summary>
  <p>
    When a majority of tenants unite, we have real power. Over 50% membership shows the landlord that most residents demand change — not just a few voices. 
    It also creates <strong>collective safety</strong>: if everyone participates, management can’t single out individuals. 
    Reaching a majority ensures that our demands carry undeniable weight and everyone is protected under a shared voice.
  </p>
</details>

<br><br>

<details>
  <summary><strong>What issues can a tenant association address?</strong></summary>
  <p>
    <strong>Anything that affects our quality of life.</strong> That includes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Maintenance and repair delays</li>
    <li>Unsafe or unsanitary conditions</li>
    <li>Poor communication from management</li>
    <li>Unfair rent hikes or fees</li>
    <li>Unclear or inconsistent lease policies</li>
    <li>Lack of transparency on deposits or inspections</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If it affects one tenant, it likely affects others. A collective approach ensures that <strong>no one’s problem gets ignored</strong>.
  </p>
</details>

<br><br>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Does organizing actually work?</strong></summary>
  <p>
    Yes — across the country, tenant unions have won major victories:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong><a href="https://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article288983214.html" target="_blank">KC Tenants (Kansas City, MO)</a></strong>: In 2024, Independence Towers tenants won a legally binding agreement forcing repairs, rent stabilization, and forgiveness of $289,000 in back rent.</li>
    <li><strong>KC Tenants citywide</strong>: Helped pass a Tenant Bill of Rights and Right to Counsel for renters facing eviction.</li>
    <li><strong><a href="https://www.newhavenindependent.org/article/tenants_union_ordinance_passed" target="_blank">New Haven, CT</a></strong>: Tenants organized to stop rent hikes and pushed the city to protect tenant unions.</li>
    <li><strong>Brattleboro, VT</strong>: Tenants won caps on security deposits, saving renters hundreds of dollars.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These examples prove that <strong>organizing works</strong> — whether you’re fighting for repairs, fairness, or respect.
  </p>
</details>

<br><br>

<details>
  <summary><strong>How much time will this take?</strong></summary>
  <p>
    Participation is flexible. At minimum, joining means staying informed — that alone helps. 
    We may hold short monthly meetings or share updates online or by flyer. 
    You decide how much to be involved: read updates, attend meetings, or volunteer for small tasks. 
    There are no required duties or fees, and no one will pressure you to do more than you’re able.
  </p>
</details>

<br><br>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Can I participate anonymously?</strong></summary>
  <p>
    Yes. Membership lists are <strong>private</strong> and not shared with management. 
    You can choose to stay low-profile, receive updates quietly, or not attach your name to public letters. 
    We’ll have a few visible tenant leaders, but most members can stay anonymous until they feel safe. 
    Once a majority joins, anonymity becomes less necessary — <strong>safety grows with solidarity</strong>.
  </p>
</details>

<br><br>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Does it cost anything?</strong></summary>
  <p>
    No. Joining is <strong>completely free</strong>. Flint Hills Tenants United is volunteer-run and doesn’t charge dues. 
    If we ever need small funds (like printing flyers), we’ll decide democratically and keep it voluntary. 
    Your <strong>time and voice</strong> matter more than money.
  </p>
</details>

<br><br>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Is this political or radical?</strong></summary>
  <p>
    No. This isn’t about party politics or ideology. Tenant associations include people of every background who want the same thing — 
    <strong>a safe, fair, and livable home</strong>. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Flint Hills Tenants United is nonpartisan and focuses only on housing justice. 
    We use peaceful, democratic methods — petitions, meetings, and negotiation — not partisan activism. 
    It’s not “radical” to ask that rent is fair, the roof doesn’t leak, and management treats tenants with respect.
  </p>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Who is Flint Hills Tenants United?</strong></summary>
  <p>
    <a href="https://www.flinthillstenantsunited.org/" target="_blank"><strong>Flint Hills Tenants United (FHTU)</strong></a> is a local, grassroots organization of renters across the Flint Hills region of Kansas.

    <a href="https://www.kansaslegalservices.org/" target="_blank">Kansas Legal Services</a>. 
    FHTU isn’t in charge — <strong>Geary Estate tenants are</strong>. FHTU advise and assist while tenants lead their own associations.
